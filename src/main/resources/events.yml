# The 'events:' section has a sub-section for each configured event.
#
# The 'birthday:' and 'anniversary:' events are special in that they are based on
# dates stored in the server. They can be disabled by removing or commenting them
# out in the configuration.
#
# Events with dates apply to all players with the proper permissions.
#
# Each event has these options:
# date - Date of the event, ignored for 'birthday:' and 'anniversary:' events
# belated - Should the gift be given after the event has passed, default is false
# annoucement - An optional message will be made server wide whenever a player 
# joins matching the event date and if they have not already exhausted their 
# allotment of messages.


# Explanation of advanced events:
# Advanced events can be used to give players a gift for every day they join.
# The numbers of days are not limited and can be over 365(a year) too.
# Advanced events do not support announcements, specific dates or the belated option!
# An Example can be found at the end of the file.


# For each type of event gifts can be configured through the 'gift:' section
# with the following properties:
# items - Items to be put in player's inventory
# name - Name to give to items if not specified for item seperately
# message - Message to give to player when they recieve the gift


# Explanation of items:
# items: is a list of associative arrays with each associative array having:
# id - Indicates which item to use. This can be the numerial id of the object
#    or a string from the Bukkit Material enum
# enchantments - Optional associative array with id as the key and 
#    level as the value. The id can either be an integer enchantment id or
#    a string with a name from the Bukkit Enchantment enum
# amount - Optional number of the item to give
# name - Optional name to give to item instead of one specified in gift section
# damage - Optional damage/durability to assign to the given item

# Announcement and gift messages are formatted with the Java String Formatter
# and passed player_name, and a Calendar date
