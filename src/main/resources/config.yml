# Announcement and gift messages are formatted with the Java String Formatter
# And passed player_name, Calendar date

# For each type of event a gift can be configured through the gift: section
# with the following properties:
# enabled - Is the gift given 
# belated - Is the gift given after the event has passed
# items - Items to be put in player's inventory
# name - Name to give to gift, as if applied by an anvil

# Explanation of items:
# items: is a list of associative arrays with each associative array having:
# id - Item id
# enchantments - Associative array with id as the key and level as the value
# amount - Optional number of the item to give

# The birthday: and anniversary: are special in that they are based on
# dates stored in server data and make server wide announcements.

# The accountment section for birthday and anniversary: have these options:
# enabled - Whether or not to make an annoucement whenever the player joins
# on the day in question.
# message - The message that will be broadcast
# max_num - How many times in one day the message will be broadcast before
# stopping. So if a player logs on and off several times, the annoucement
# only happens this number of times. And only if the last message was made
# annoucment_interval minutes previously

# Time in minutes between annoucements should a player log off then back on
announcement_interval: 30

# Format used for parsing dates present in config file by SimpleDateFormat
# anything other than month and day in the parsed time will be discarded
date_format: "MM-dd"
